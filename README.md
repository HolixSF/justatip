# Pre-work - **Justatip**

**Justatip** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Luis De Castro**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1**: "What are your reactions to the iOS app development platform so far? How would you describe outlets and actions to another developer? Bonus: any idea how they are being implemented under the hood? (It might give you some ideas if you right-click on the Storyboard and click Open As->Source Code")

**Answer:** I like working with an IDE like Xcode where I can see my work play out visually. I would describe outlets and actions as sort of event listeners that you assign to elements on the page. When checking the source code of the storyboard, it looks like a huge XML file. I dont really know much a bout xml so I cant say I know how its working under the hood but from skimming it, it just seems like a bunch of elements with properties and attributes assigned to each one.

**Question 2**: "Swift uses [Automatic Reference Counting](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH20-ID49) (ARC), which is not a garbage collector, to manage memory. Can you explain how you can get a strong reference cycle for closures? (There's a section explaining this concept in the link, how would you summarize as simply as possible?)"

**Answer:** A strong reference cycle in closures is created when a closure is assigned to a property of a class that relies on the instance of that class. For example, calling `self` within a closure to access its instances properties will cause the closure to capture `self` and creating a strong reference.
